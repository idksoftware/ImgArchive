#EXIF data
Exif information is a photographic standard that most if not all camera manufactures use to encode information into images. It is a photographic standard by which information about both the image and the camera that captured that image is stored within the image file.
In order to read this information an Exif reader is required. This information is normally stored in JPG images; however other formats can also have the Exif information encoded.
