Introduction to the Command Terminal

Before Windows was created, the most common operating system ran from a terminal normally 132 characters by 25 or 80 lines. One of the most used was the VT100 terminal. That meant in order to run programs or manipulate the operating system you had to manually type in commands. When Windows was first created it was actually a graphical user interface that was created in order to make using the operating system easier for a novice user, also Unix moved to graphical user interface called X Windows. The display thermal was then made redundant. However almost all windows and Unix commands can be run from a terminal so the terminal on graphical operating systems was replaced with a window that emulated the old VT100 called a Command Terminal. Some call it a console window others may call it a shell window. All the modern operating systems have the ability to display a Command Terminal.

Why does SIA 
SIA for the sake of simplicity and uses command line tools that can be access in the most basic of ways that is pretty much uniform across operating systems.
