File naming
Digital cameras generate huge numbers of files with similar or identical names, i.e. the file names start from 0000 each time you format the memory card for example. As of this writing, no cameras that I am aware of will give you sufficient options to automatically generate unique filenames. However once an image is imported into Image Archive, Image Archive will give the image a unique filename ID and preserve the extension. If there are more than one image of the same shot then both of the images will be renamed the same. For example Nikon and Cannon provide RAW + jpg for each shot taken, Image Archive will make sure both are stored together with the same name but different extensions (.NEF and JPG). These extensions will be maintained as the originals in order to ensure greater compatibility.
Using this information Image Archive creates a duplicate database. In this database all the image checksums are added, along with their ID. This database can then be queried to see if the same image has been added to the Archive before.
