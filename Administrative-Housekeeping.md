administrative housekeeping
4.	Housekeeping Commands
a.	Mirror commands
b.	Archive validation commands
c.	Backup commands
In addition there are a number of global arguments that control how the SIA program executes. I.e. changing the logging level, changing command terminal options etc. 
Many of the command line options can be defaulted using environment variables or the main configuration file. See environment variables and   configuration file
While SIA has different options for its subcommands however all options have the same meaning if used in different subcommands. For example â€“verbose (-v) always means verbose output to the control terminal regardless of the subcommand being used.
SIA will normality exit quickly with an error if it is passed an option that does not apply to the subcommand
