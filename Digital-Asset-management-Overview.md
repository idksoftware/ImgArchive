#Digital Asset management Overview

Can you find your digital images when you need them, or do you spent more time looking through endless folders on your hard drive? This can be even worse if you spent hours editing the image in Photoshop but can’t find the latest version. The Image archive provides an organised place to store digital images for safe keeping, editing and viewing. SIA is a full featured Digital Image archive system with version control following the Digital Asset Management (DAM) design goals. 



Do No Harm


Never manipulate your original media, i.e. the original image or images. Once the original is changed there is no way to revert to the untouched original its lost forever, always work on a copy of the original never the only copy of the original? SIA supports versioning. When you make changes to an image in SIA you check the image out of the workspace for changes. Once the changes are made you then check the image back into the workspace. The changed version will be the current image in the workspace but the original will be preserved in the archive untouched. Each time you make a change a new version of the image will be made. If you wish to go back to the original or a previous version of the original the you can check it out into the workspace. The original is safe guarded along with any changes you made of versions of the original which in them selves may have had a number of hours invested in them. 



Be Safe With Your Data


Digital images fractions of a second to make and fractions of a second to destroy or lost. This can happen in a number of ways. For best protection, use the 3-2-1 rule of duplicating your data. 

◾ 3 Keep at least three copies of your data: your primary copy and two backups.


◾ 2 Keep your copies on two different, physically separate media. One set of files will likely be on your computer hard drive. Keep your two copies separated, each backed up to different media (external hard drives, USB flash drives, or cloud storage services).


◾ 1 Keep one copy of your images offsite. Some people use a system of rotating two external hard drives, swapping out one hard drive each week or each month, depending upon how frequently you add data. I use USB flash drives and store them in a small safe in someone else’s home. A cloud storage service also works well. Just be certain that you are using a cloud backup service and not a file-syncing tool.




Back Up Supporting Documents


As part of the DAM process is to create metadata on you images 

At its core SIA uses the base Operating Systems file system in order to store image in an organised file structure. Metadata associated with each image is also stored in an organised file structure with addition of an optional SQLite database.
