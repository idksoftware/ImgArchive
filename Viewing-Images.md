Viewing Images
SIA provides a main archive view allowing you to view and possibly edit the images held within the archive. When images are added to the archive this archive view provides a complete view of all images in the archive. These images are set read-only to avoid accidental modification of the images.  This is normally located in the pictures folder on a windows machine and the Desktop in the case of a Mac or Linux machine. This will allow you to browse your images using the system browser (File explorer on Windows, File on Mac and File Browser on Linux). By using the system file browsers means the archives images are more unified with the host operating system and makes them more accessible to third party tools. This view is called the master view.
The Master View
As this view contains the complete set of images in the archive then as mentioned above this is also a convenient place to edit images. By default when an image is checked-out it is this default view that the image will be checked-out too. After an image is checked-out it can be safely edited as the system has been informed that this is what you wish to do and not editing by accident.
Image Set views
The master view contains all images in the archive however, this view is the complete view of the archive there are usually times then only a set of images which are found in a set list or searched for under some criteria are grouped in to a subset of images need to be views as a group. There are four types of groupings:
1.	An Inclusive list
2.	An Exclusive list
3.	An Inclusive search based on defined criteria.
4.	An Exclusive search based on defined criteria.
These grouping forms the bases of the view all images that are selected as part of the list or search process will be include in the view. For example the criteria may be that you may wish to view all publishable images. In which case SIA can search the archive and select all publishable images and put them into a view (an inclusive search). You can invert the search by selecting all the images that are not to be published by using a same search criteria but using an exclusive search.
