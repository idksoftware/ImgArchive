Using SIA Configuration File
This file is used for configuring the SIA global options. These options can be overridden on the command line or environment variables so can be set as defaults. These options are especially useful for things such as the path to the current repository which needs to be known frequently but changes infrequently.   These options are as follows:
 Archive-Folder=<path>
Source-Folder=<path>
Logging-level=<level>
